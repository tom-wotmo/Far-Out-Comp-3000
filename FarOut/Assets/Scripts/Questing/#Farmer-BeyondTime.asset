  title: Beyond my time
  description: Finally! there have been so few adventurers passing through here recently,
    the bandit issue has become too dangerous around this area. I could use your
    help? A large boulder turned up on my property three moons ago! Mountain Trolls?
    Raining Rocks? Bah who cares! I need it rid of, would you please destroy it for
    me? I'm sure I have some equipment an adventurer like you could use.
