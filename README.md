# Far Out

Far Out is a final year university piece that delves into Unity's new OpenXR development, this open world prototype features the beginning of an immersive open world RPG. questing, sword combat and the ability to chop down and mine rocks are planned for 1.0 release.

-- 1.0 release will feature a prototype of Far Out, with a questing system that allows you to interact with NPC's and gain rewards. The resource destruction will tie into your questing experience, with NPC's asking you to destroy and clear certain parts of the land! Sword combat is also present, being able to kill and be killed with first person sword combat once you gain your first weapon.

-- 1.1 release will look further into the combat system and player leveling. I would like to also utilize the resource destruction and implement a simple resource management or crafting system but this is planned for later in the year. Inventory management is QoL update I would like to implement to save you from storing items in a safe place and only being able to carry two at once.
